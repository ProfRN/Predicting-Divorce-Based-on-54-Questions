# Predicting-Divorce-Based-on-54-Questions

This project explores the questions to a survey whose 170 rows of data are accessible at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set#

In the form of 54 questions on the attitudes behaviors, and values held by individuals in a marriage, researchers examined the lives of married couples. After a period, these same individuals were again surveyed to ask if they had remained in the same marriage or exited. Their responses are the target feature for this project's model training and testing.

Notes on the data:
- Each column is summarized by its question number by name. All full questions are available on the UCI repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set#
- Responses are recorded in values of 0-4, where 0 is the least likely, and 4 is the most.
- The "Class" column indicates divorce status: "0" for married, and "1" for divorced.
- The metadata was provided by a Turkish academic study. Some meaning appears to have been lost in translation.
